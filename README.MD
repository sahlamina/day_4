Stakeholders
-	People interested in the success of / can be affected by proj business: internal and external
-	Stkh objectives
-	Two main examples of stkh mgmt – agreeing deliverables
Software development life cycles
-	Process used to design develop and test high quality software
-	Reduce cost while shortening production time
-	Waterfall
o	More traditional approach, very linear
o	Used when requirements are clear and there’s no need for adaptations
-	Agile
o	Iterating through cycles, typically in sprints and with retrospectives
o	Focuses on change and adaptability
-	V-model – verification and validation
o	Verification process
	Confirms that the systems fulfil design requirements
	It is a measure of build
o	Validation process
	Validation is the process of checking whether the specification captures the customer’s needs
	It is a measure of performance
o	Follows sequential as well as parallel flow of prod development
o	Should be used for small to medium sized projects

The project Environment
Projects vs business as usual
-	Proj is unique and transient with a desired outcome
-	BAU is the normal execution of standard operations within an organisation
Proj lifecycle
-	Initiation, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, closing
-	Triple constraint
o	Time, Quality, Cost
o	These three impact each other 
-	Netflix once used monolithic architecture- everything worked with each other so one fail, all fails
-	Wanted to change into microservices architecture and migrate to cloud instead of on premises architecture, this took 6 years because they had to undo their architecture and then rebuild it
-	156 mil users now
POPIT model
-	People, organisation, process, ITechnology

Software development life cycle
-	Waterfall, v model, agile
-	Waterfall
o	System requirements, software reqr, analysis, programme design, coding, testing, operations
o	Pseudo coding, using comments in place of actual code before you use actual code
-	Planning
-	Agile (iterative)
o	Plan, do, check and repeat. Take on criticisms and implement improvements
o	Small teams 6-8 ppl working on front end, back ends and database
	They don’t need to wait on one another to test and iterate and intergrate
o	Helps to release products quickly
-	The holistic triangle – kenben??
